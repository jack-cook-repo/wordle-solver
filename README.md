Welcome!

This repo has a couple of files of interest:
- **answers.txt:** Taken from [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/main.e65ce0a5.js), 
  the first ~2,300 word array (starting with the word "cigar") is [assumed to be the set of possible 
  answers for Wordle](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/114518)
- **Wordle solver - exploration.ipynb:** My notebook with all the relevant code 

I'm looking to build this out into a streamlit app, but leaving the above files untouched. Watch this space...
